# Intro to VEXcode V5 Blocks

This is a guide on the basics of VEXcode blocks.  
[Video guide here](https://github.com/9204A-B/intro-block?tab=readme-ov-file#video-guide)

## How to get started
First start by downloading VEXcode [here](https://link.vex.com/vexcode-v5blocks-windows) or by using their VEXcode online [here](https://codev5.vex.com/).

  No setup required! Just follow the above link.   

  This only works with a Chromium based browser: Chrome, Edge, Opera, ect.  
  Firefox and Safari will not work.

Once it's open it should look this

## How to use the app
### Slots
At the top you can select the slot on the brain that your program will be saved to 
Note: When uploading code it will overwrite any other programs stored in that slot. There is a maximum of 8 programs that can be stored on the brain

### Project Name
To the right of the slots button you can click the project name (appears as VEXcode Project) to rename it before uploading to the brain

### Initalizing Devices
In order to get started you need to add the devices first, otherwise the blocks for them won't appear.  
First select the 2nd option below the run and download options

In this example I will configure a simple drivetrain.  
![App Screenshot](screenshots/Devicelist.png)  
First I'll select a drivetrain object not a motor.
![App Screenshot](screenshots/motorConfig.png)  
Pretty simple just select what ports the motors are connected to.

99.9% of the time you will select No gyro.

Setting up all of these measures are not required they mainly 
help with things like auton and shouldn't be necessary for 
driver control. However there is one useful option here.
On the right side with the robot icon, you can reverse the 
motors by clicking the grey arrow if the robot is going 
backwards.  
![App Screenshot](screenshots/controller.png)  
Next we will add a controller.  
![App Screenshot](screenshots/controllerSetup.png)  
Just click the joystick icons and it will go through different 
drivetrain setups.  
At this point you could upload the code by connecting the robot 
and hitting download.  
### Simple Program Example
![App Screenshot](screenshots/programExample.png)  
Here is an example of an initalized drivetrain, 
controller, and a motor.  
The toggle button example allows the motor to spin until you
press the button again.  
### How to run your program  
There are two ways to run your program once it's been uploaded 
to the brain.  

**From the controller**  
![Controller Screenshot](screenshots/controllerscreenshot.png)  
Navigate using the arrow keys  
Select programs and navigate to the selected slot and hit run  

**From the brain**  
![Brain Screenshot](screenshots/brain.png)  
Click on the program at the bottom or select the programs folder
to see everything.
